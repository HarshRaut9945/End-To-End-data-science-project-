##  End to end  machine learning project 


Why do we need a logger in ML projects?

Machine learning projects are long and complex. A logger helps you:

✅ Track model training progress
✅ Debug errors and crashes
✅ Monitor data preprocessing steps
✅ Record hyperparameters and metrics
✅ Maintain production-level code


What is utils.py?

utils.py is not a default Python file — it is created by developers to store:

Common helper functions

Repeated logic

Small reusable code blocks

Think of it as a toolbox 🧰 for your ML project.
